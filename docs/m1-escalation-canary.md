# Milestone 1: escalation ladder canary

## Status

| Tier | Proof status |
|------|----------------|
| Deterministic only | Proven in production refresh (most repos) |
| Local primary model | Proven with engineered conflicting-workflow canary |
| Local second opinion | **Proven live** (2026-07-08 canary; forced low-confidence primary + HTTP second opinion) |
| Strong remote | Wired; optional third step when second opinion remains low-confidence |
| Confident abstention | Proven on genuine polyglot ties (correct termination) |

Primary-tier proof and the Absent low-confidence continuation fix are described
in `ROADMAP.md` (active execution order, Milestone 1). The second-opinion live
proof is recorded in
`index/telemetry/m1-second-opinion-canary-20260708.md` and automated as
`second_opinion_live_ladder_from_low_confidence_primary` in
`crates/dotrepo-crawler/tests/openrouter_env_escalation.rs`.

## Why confident abstention is not enough

A confident model `Absent` (no single honest command) must **stop** escalation.
Only a **low-confidence** primary `Absent` or `Rejected` should climb the ladder.
Hard polyglot repos that abstain confidently are success for correctness, not
proof that tier-3/4 ran.

## Canary procedure (operator)

1. **Environment** — run against a throwaway public repository or a private
   fixture repo you control. Enable adjudication sidecars:

   ```bash
   export INDEX_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=true
   # primary + second-opinion + remote providers per crawler/adjudication env
   # see scripts/adjudication_openrouter_sidecar.py and crawler README
   ```

2. **Force low-confidence primary** — prefer a repository whose same-tier
   candidates are incomplete or weakly evidenced (not a clean three-way tie the
   primary can confidently refuse). If the primary returns high-confidence
   Absent, the canary did not exercise tier-3; adjust evidence, not the ladder.

3. **Crawl with JSON**:

   ```bash
   cargo run -p dotrepo-crawler -- crawl \
     --host github.com --owner <owner> --repo <repo> \
     --write --json
   ```

4. **Pass criteria** — escalation report includes:
   - `modelCalls >= 2` (primary + at least one higher tier), or
   - `adjudicationTiersUsed` containing a second-opinion / API tier after a
     low-confidence primary outcome
   - final field still passes post-checks (candidate set, validation)
   - telemetry retained in the batch NDJSON with non-zero tokens for those tiers

5. **Record** — append a short note under
   `index/telemetry/` (or the batch output dir) with repository identity,
   tier list, and whether the final value was resolved vs honest abstention.

## Automated canary (preferred)

With the adjudication sidecar running and `.env` loaded
(`DOTREPO_ADJUDICATION_SECOND_OPINION_URL` required):

```bash
cargo test -p dotrepo-crawler --test openrouter_env_escalation \
  second_opinion_live_ladder_from_low_confidence_primary -- --nocapture
```

This stubs only the primary tier to a low-confidence `Absent` (because real
repos almost never produce that shape), then requires a live HTTP second-opinion
provider. Pass criteria: `model_calls >= 2` and
`LocalSecondOpinion` (or `ApiEscalation`) in `adjudication_tiers_used`.

## Offline regression

Escalation policy (including low-confidence Absent continuation) is covered by
unit tests in `crates/dotrepo-core/src/import/escalation.rs`.
