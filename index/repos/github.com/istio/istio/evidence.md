# Evidence

- Imported repository name and docs entry points from README.md.
- Imported maintainer candidates from CODEOWNERS. Maintainer information was imported from broad CODEOWNERS patterns with multiple team owners, so `owners.team` was left unset and `owners.maintainers` preserves the competing owner candidates.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred repo.build from go.mod as `go build ./...`.
- Inferred repo.test from go.mod as `go test ./...`.
- Imported repo.toolchain.min from go.mod as `1.27.0` (Go).
- Discovered related relation to github.com/istio/istio from README cross-link.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
