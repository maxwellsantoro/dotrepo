# Evidence

- Imported repository name from README.md.
- Inferred fallback values for `repo.description` because the imported files did not provide enough structured metadata.
- Inferred repo.build from go.mod as `go build ./...`.
- Inferred repo.test from go.mod as `go test ./...`.
- Imported repo.toolchain.min from go.mod as `1.20` (Go).
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.

- Set `repo.name` to `gau` from `GitHub API` after deterministic escalation.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
