# Evidence

- Imported repository name from README.md.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred repo.build from .github/workflows/build.yml as `cargo build --locked`.
- Inferred repo.test from .github/workflows/build.yml as `cargo test --locked`.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.

- Set `repo.name` to `rustls` from `GitHub API` after deterministic escalation.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
