# Evidence

- Imported repository name and docs entry points from README.md.
- Imported maintainer candidates from CODEOWNERS.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Left `repo.build` unset because `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` and `.github/workflows/fork-checks.yml` suggested conflicting build commands.
- Imported repo.test from package.json as `yarn test`.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.

- Left `repo.build` unset after deterministic escalation: no unique build/test candidate after deterministic tier walk. Preserved 2 candidate command(s) in `repo.build_candidates` instead of discarding them.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
