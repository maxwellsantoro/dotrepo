# Evidence

- Imported repository name from README.md.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred repo.build from pyproject.toml as `python -m build`.
- Inferred repo.test from pyproject.toml as `python -m pytest`.
- Imported repo.toolchain.min from pyproject.toml as `3.10` (Python).
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).

## 2026-10-06 bounded risk audit

Statically inspected source revision `1541f590c7099820f10ea012f48d2399282df69f` at `2026-10-06T04:07:21.224082Z`. Sources, hashes and all declared field dispositions are retained in [the audit receipt](../../../../telemetry/roadmap-risk-audit-2026-10-06.json).

- `repo.build`: unsupported-inference. Setuptools build backend metadata supplies no declared python -m build repository instruction; no such entrypoint in inspected README/guide.
- `repo.test`: unsupported-inference. Inspected manifest and README/guide do not declare pytest as the project test entrypoint; withhold rather than infer a usable default.
- `docs.root`: unsupported-documentation-association. README calls this URL the Project Page for information, demos and examples; it labels separate repository documents as Documentation. That does not establish the project landing page as docs.root.

Record age/status and unrelated facts/assessments remain unchanged. New source-grounded command/context assessments are newer than the record timestamp; the public exporter drops them until a coherent full-record recrawl. No upstream commands were executed, and no fresh pipeline verification or current-HEAD inspection is claimed. Absence is limited to the inspected sources.

This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
