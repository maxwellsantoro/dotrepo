# Evidence

- Imported repository name and description from README.md.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred repo.build from .github/workflows/build-apps.yml as `bun run build:android:local`.
- Imported repo.test from package.json as `npm test`.
- Discovered related relation to github.com/streamyfin/jellyfin-plugin-streamyfin from README cross-link.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
