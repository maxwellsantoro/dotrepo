# Evidence

- Imported repository name, description, and docs entry points from README.md.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Left `repo.build` unset because `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml` suggested conflicting build commands.
- Left `repo.test` unset because `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml` suggested conflicting test commands.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.

- Set `repo.build` to `cargo build --profile no-debug` from `.github/workflows/build-dev-binaries.yml` after deterministic escalation.
- Left `repo.test` unset after model escalation: The candidates represent distinct, non-overlapping technology stacks (Rust vs Python) within the same repository context, indicating a polyglot repository with no single primary test command..
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Filled repo.description from GitHub repository metadata when the README surface did not provide one.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
