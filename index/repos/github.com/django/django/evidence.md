# Evidence

- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred fallback values for `repo.name` and `repo.description` because the imported files did not provide enough structured metadata.
- Inferred repo.build from pyproject.toml as `python -m build`.
- Left `repo.test` unset because `package.json` and `pyproject.toml` suggested conflicting test commands.
- Imported repo.toolchain.min from pyproject.toml as `3.12` (Python).
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.

- Set `repo.test` to `tox` from `tox.ini` after model escalation.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
