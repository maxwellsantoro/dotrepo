# Evidence

- Inferred fallback values for `repo.name` because the imported files did not provide enough structured metadata.
- Imported repo.build from Makefile as `make build`.
- Imported repo.test from Makefile as `make test`.
- Imported repo.toolchain.min from go.mod as `1.24.0` (Go).
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
