# Evidence

- Imported repository name and docs entry points from README.md.
- Imported maintainer candidates from CODEOWNERS. Maintainer information was imported from CODEOWNERS; `owners.team` is `@PowerShell/powershell-maintainers` because it is the clearest imported team signal, but `owners.maintainers` still preserves narrower owner candidates.
- Imported the security reporting channel from SECURITY.md. SECURITY.md provided a policy or reporting URL rather than a direct mailbox, so `security_contact` preserves that URL.
- Inferred fallback values for `repo.description` because the imported files did not provide enough structured metadata.
- Discovered related relation to github.com/discussions/quickstart from README cross-link.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Filled repo.description from GitHub repository metadata when the README surface did not provide one.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
