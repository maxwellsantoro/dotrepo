# Evidence

- Imported repository name and docs entry points from README.md.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).

## Auto-promotion

All fields are high-confidence present or high-confidence absent. Record auto-promoted to verified status.

## Documentation correction (2026-09-21T04:36:55.205964Z)

- Withheld docs.root; rejected `https://pytwitchapi.dev/en/stable/index.html#user-authentication` because Twitch API authentication documentation belongs to a dependency. Source: [README.md:124](https://github.com/kimjammer/Neuro/blob/5e4b4241c41bb40983aee2cb60d65d6bb481842b/README.md#L124). No replacement was established by this correction.
- Downgraded prior `verified` status to `inferred`: the withheld documentation field remains unresolved; prior verification is not inherited.
- This documentation-only correction advances the record timestamp. Older assessments for other fields retain their original check times and are invalidated by public export until fresh verification; their values were not refreshed.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
