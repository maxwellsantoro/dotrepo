# Evidence

- Imported repository name from README.md.
- Imported SECURITY.md, but no explicit contact channel was parsed, so security_contact = "unknown" is intentional.
- Inferred repo.build from src/Build.sln as `dotnet build`.
- Inferred repo.test from src/Build.sln as `dotnet test`.
- This is an overlay record, not a maintainer-controlled canonical record.
- Augmented repo.homepage from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.license from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.visibility from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.languages from GitHub repository metadata.
- Augmented repo.topics from GitHub repository metadata.
- Constrained repo.description with GitHub repository metadata.
- Recorded GitHub-only crawl metadata under x.github (default branch, head SHA, stars, archive state, and fork state).
